NOTES FOR THE MORNING

We should make the repository private and use a token / set credentials in k8s
this helps show max security is considered


Steps to create test env

NOTE: Ensure all selectors match for test env (ie. app: bahttleship)
1. Build the game Image and push to repository
2. Create a k8s job with new Image to run game (maybe new image name will be based on env variable?)
    NOTE: Wait until running
3. Create DNS service
4. Start k8s job for selenium (see instructions file you made)
    -- get logs from run, print to jenkins console
    -- find a way to limit number of failures
5. If successful, delete both the game and selenium jobs
6. Initiate push to production pipeline
