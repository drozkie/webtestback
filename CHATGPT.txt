You can configure Jenkins to wait for a Job to complete in Kubernetes by using the Kubernetes Continuous Deploy plugin.

Here are the steps to follow:

Install the Kubernetes Continuous Deploy plugin in your Jenkins instance.

Create a new Jenkins pipeline job and configure it to use the Kubernetes Continuous Deploy plugin.

In the pipeline script, use the kubernetesDeploy step to deploy the Job in Kubernetes. Here's an example:

php
Copy code
stage('Deploy Job') {
    steps {
        kubernetesDeploy(
            kubeconfigId: '<kubeconfig-id>',
            configs: 'path/to/job.yaml',
            enableConfigSubstitution: true,
            wait: true,
            verify: true
        )
    }
}
Replace <kubeconfig-id> with the ID of your Kubernetes configuration in Jenkins, and path/to/job.yaml with the path to your Job configuration file.

In the kubernetesDeploy step, set the wait parameter to true to make Jenkins wait for the Job to complete before moving on to the next step.

You can also set the verify parameter to true to verify that the Job completed successfully before continuing.

After the Job completes, you can retrieve the logs or other output using the Kubernetes API or kubectl commands.

By configuring Jenkins to wait for the Job to complete, you can ensure that your pipeline runs smoothly and that your application is deployed successfully in Kubernetes.

How can I get the logs from a kubernetes job back into the jenkins pipeline?
You can get the logs from a Kubernetes Job back into the Jenkins pipeline by using the Kubernetes Continuous Deploy plugin and the Kubernetes API.

Here are the steps to follow:

Deploy your Kubernetes Job using the kubernetesDeploy step in the Jenkins pipeline, as described in my previous answer.

After the Job completes, use the Kubernetes API to retrieve the logs for the Pods in the Job. You can do this using the following command:

php
Copy code
kubectl logs <pod-name>
Replace <pod-name> with the name of the Pod that you want to retrieve the logs for.

In the Jenkins pipeline, use the kubernetesApi step from the Kubernetes Continuous Deploy plugin to retrieve the logs from the Kubernetes API. Here's an example:

php
Copy code
stage('Retrieve Logs') {
    steps {
        script {
            def podName = sh(returnStdout: true, script: "kubectl get pods -l job-name=<job-name> -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}'")
            def logs = kubernetesApi(
                kubeconfigId: '<kubeconfig-id>',
                resourceType: 'pods',
                resourceName: podName,
                subResource: 'log'
            )
            echo logs
        }
    }
}
Replace <job-name> with the name of your Job, <kubeconfig-id> with the ID of your Kubernetes configuration in Jenkins, and echo logs with whatever action you want to take with the logs.

In the kubernetesApi step, set the resourceType parameter to 'pods' and the subResource parameter to 'log' to retrieve the logs from the Kubernetes API.

By retrieving the logs from the Kubernetes API, you can easily integrate them into your Jenkins pipeline and take whatever actions you need to based on the contents of the logs.
